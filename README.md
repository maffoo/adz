# Ad fillers for use with Google COntributor

[Google Contributor](https://www.google.com/contributor/) lets you pay some
money to sites instead of seeing conventional web ads.
You have the option to set a custom URL to display in place of the ads, and this
app is an option.
It's running at https://foo-adz.appspot.com; if you like it you can set this as
your contributor custom URL.
